                                    Buying a house for the first time starts with gaining a solid understanding of the process. Transitioning from renting to owning is achievable with the help of experienced and professional partners. First time home buyers should begin by researching lenders and connecting with a licensed loan originator. Next, a prospective home buyer should prepare to discuss their income, assets and home buying goals with their lender. First time home buyers should expect to provide personal information and financial information for review during a pre-approval process. The pre-approval process will help a first time home buyer know how much home they can afford before they begin house hunting. After getting pre-approved, a first time home buyer should research properties that fit within their budget.

                                    There are many down payment options available for first time home buyers. First time home buyers are not required to make a 20% down payment on a home unless they choose to do so. In fact, many homeowners are approved for mortgages with down payments below 10%. There are many first-time home buyer mortgage programs that offer a minimum down payment as low as 3%. There are also low and no down payment mortgage loan options available for first time home buyers. Some of the loan programs that offer these attractive down payment requirements are FHA loans, USDA loan, VA loans and specific conventional loan programs from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

                                    Before starting the home buying and mortgage application process, first time home buyers should keep in mind these helpful tips. First, check your credit score, improving your credit score before applying for a mortgage can help you to qualify for a lower interest rate and could help you increase overall affordability. Next, consider fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans and compare different terms based on your financial goals. Third, obtain a pre-approval from a licensed loan originator before house hunting; this can make sellers see you as a more attractive buyer. Lastly, once your mortgage application is submitted, avoid buying furniture on credit or using credit cards to make other large purchases; this could negatively affect your credit score which could jeopardize your loan in its final stages.

                                    Qualifying factors for first time home buyers will vary based on the mortgage program and lender they choose. Usually at minimum, first time home buyers need to provide a proof of reliable income. In addition, depending on the loan program, first time home buyers should also have at least a fair or good FICO score typically 580 or higher and a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio that conforms to certain mortgage underwriting guidelines. An experienced loan officer can help you learn your DTI. Although there are low and no-down payment options for many first-time home buyer mortgage programs, first time buyers should prepare to save some funds toward a down payment, closing costs, taxes and moving costs.
